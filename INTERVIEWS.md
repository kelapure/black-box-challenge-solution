# Employee Discovery Interviews

## John from Finance

**Role:** Director of Reimbursement & Expense Strategy (since 2004)  
**Date:** March 28, 2025  
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**TPM:** Hey John, thanks for hopping on.

**John:** Of course, happy to do it. You folks must be up to your ears trying to make sense of this thing. [laughs]

**TPM:** You could say that. Before we dive in—how was your weekend?

**John:** Oh, it was solid. Got in a quick 9 on Saturday morning over at Stonebridge. Greens are still a little soft, but hey, March golf in the Midwest? You take what you can get.

**TPM:** [laughs] True. I imagine golf is how you recharge from all this reimbursement chaos.

**John:** You don't even know. Honestly, some of my best policy decisions have come to me on the 6th tee. Something about watching a terrible approach shot clears the mind.

**TPM:** I'll have to try that. Okay, well—let's get into it. We're trying to reverse-engineer the old reimbursement system.

**John:** Brave of you. That thing is older than my career, and I've been here since ACME still printed travel vouchers on carbon paper.

**TPM:** We're starting with the basics—per diem and mileage seem like foundational pieces. Does that sound right?

**John:** Yeah, that's fair. Though I'd say "foundational" is doing a lot of work there. [laughs] Nothing in that system was ever really "documented," just kind of... absorbed over time. Oral tradition meets financial workflow.

**TPM:** Ha—financial folklore.

**John:** Exactly. We used to joke that the old devs encoded ACME's values into the system itself. Accountability, opacity, and mild punishment for travel.

**TPM:** Let's start with per diem. What's your recollection of how that part worked?

**John:** Hmm. So... I think it's safe to say that travel days usually meant you got a base amount. That's how we always explained it to employees. Like, "you were out of town, you get your daily."

But it wasn't itemized anywhere. We'd just see a lump sum, and kind of assume there was a per-day component.

**TPM:** So employees assumed they were getting a daily rate?

**John:** More or less. And it seemed consistent. I remember one trip I took to the Salt Lake office—three days, modest expenses, and the reimbursement lined up with what I'd expect if there were some sort of flat daily logic.

But there were weird exceptions too. We had a guy once fly out Sunday night, come back Tuesday morning, and he swore he only got reimbursed for one day. But that might've just been a typo on the form. Or maybe the system ignored travel days under a certain number of hours? No idea.

**TPM:** So there's no official rule about how arrival/departure time affects reimbursement?

**John:** Not that I've ever seen. If there is, it's buried in Roy Calderon's brain—and he retired during the Blackberry era. Honestly, I think the system just counted how many days you were "away," and didn't worry too much about precision.

**TPM:** What about mileage?

**John:** Ah yes. Mileage. Or, as we call it: the illusion of fairness.

**TPM:** [laughs] Go on.

**John:** So it used to be that people got excited to drive to regional sites because they thought they'd get reimbursed based on the full mileage. But then folks started noticing something funny.

Take, for example, folks driving from Dayton to Columbus—what is that, 90 miles?—they'd get a decent reimbursement. But if someone drove from Indianapolis to Cincinnati, which is a bit further—maybe 110, 120?—they actually came out lower.

**TPM:** So there's a diminishing return after a certain point?

**John:** That's what it looks like. It's like the system encourages you to go short distances, but penalizes you the farther you go. I don't know if it's linear. Probably not. Some folks used to say it's like the system "ran out of gas" after a certain mileage.

And I remember one time we did back-of-the-envelope math, and it was like... the per-mile rate past a certain point dropped by 30 to 40 percent, give or take.

**TPM:** Do you recall anyone making that change?

**John:** That would've been Roy, probably. Or Lucille from Ops. One of them said it was to "encourage local collaboration" instead of "interstate commutes." I think the real reason was they didn't want people booking 5-hour drives and expensing everything under the sun.

**TPM:** But this wasn't published anywhere?

**John:** Oh god no. That would've caused riots.

**TPM:** Does the mileage thing get more generous again if the distance gets really long?

**John:** Nope. It just stays weird. I remember someone drove from HQ to Nashville—like 300 miles or something—and was reimbursed less than someone who flew to Chicago and rented a car for 40 miles of driving.

It made no sense. We just blamed the system and moved on.

**TPM:** Have you noticed anything about how the system treats... efficiency? Like, does it care about how much ground you cover per day?

**John:** Oh, that's interesting you ask. Yeah, there's definitely something there. We had this sales guy, Marcus, who was notorious for these lightning-fast road trips. He'd hit three cities in two days, rack up like 400 miles, and somehow always came out ahead on reimbursement. Way ahead.

Meanwhile, we had another guy who'd take a week-long "training" in Milwaukee—barely left the hotel, maybe 20 miles total driving—and his reimbursement was... let's call it "disappointing."

**TPM:** So the system might reward high mileage-to-day ratios?

**John:** That's my theory. It's like it could tell when you were actually hustling versus when you were just... existing somewhere else for a while. Marcus used to joke that the system had a "road warrior bonus." Might not have been wrong.

**TPM:** Is there any part of the system that ever explained why a reimbursement came out the way it did?

**John:** Nope. You got a number. That was it. People would send in spreadsheets asking "Can you show me the breakdown?" and I'd say, "There is no breakdown. It's vibes and legacy code."

We had one guy try to build a simulator in Excel. He got close—like within $12 on average—but there was always something off. I think he gave up when a 6-day trip to Omaha reimbursed less than a 2-day trip to Akron.

**TPM:** Were there any audits or internal reviews of the system?

**John:** Not formally. I mean, we tried. In 2017, we brought in some consultants to modernize it. They spent four months mapping the logic, and then came back and said, "We don't think this is logic. We think it's folklore encoded in Fortran." [laughs]

That's when we gave up on modernizing the old system and decided we'd need to eventually replace it. Hence... you.

**TPM:** Happy to be part of the legacy. [laughs]

**John:** Look, I'll be honest. The best advice I can give you is: think like an accountant, guess like a developer, and don't expect the outputs to always make sense.

Also—play more golf. That always helps.

**TPM:** I'll keep that in mind. Thanks, John. This was actually more helpful than I expected.

**John:** My pleasure. And hey, if you ever need someone to test the new system—preferably on a business trip to Pebble Beach—you know who to call.

## Peggy from Finance

**Role:** Senior Expense Control Analyst  
**Date:** April 1, 2025  
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**TPM:** Hi Peggy! Thanks so much for taking the time.

**Peggy:** Oh, no problem at all. Always happy to lend a hand. I was just finishing up my lunch—turkey wrap and a Diet Coke. Trying to eat lighter these days, you know, get back to my Myrtle weight.

**TPM:** [laughs] Myrtle Beach?

**Peggy:** Yes! Oh, I have a little timeshare down there. North end. We've been going every summer since '98. Right near Barefoot Landing. If you've never been, you simply must. It's where I do all my budgeting resets for the new fiscal year—sun, spreadsheets, and sangria.

**TPM:** That sounds like an excellent combo.

**Peggy:** It's how I survive end-of-quarter closeouts. You should see the binder I bring. Highlight tabs for days.

**TPM:** So, jumping in—I'm helping the engineering team reverse-engineer the reimbursement system. Everyone says it's a bit of a black box.

**Peggy:** [laughs] That's putting it kindly. We call it "The Oracle." You submit receipts, and it speaks in riddles. I once expensed three nights in Cleveland, two Uber rides, and a half-eaten Panera sandwich, and it reimbursed me… I think less than if I had just not turned in anything.

**TPM:** That… tracks. What's your general sense of how the receipts are treated?

**Peggy:** Receipts, yes. So here's the thing: it absolutely looks at the total amount. You can see it in the pattern. Folks who turn in lots of receipts usually get more, but only up to a point. Then it's like... plateau city. I remember someone once turned in a $2,400 expense report after a week in San Jose—conference, hotels, whole thing—and got reimbursed about the same as someone who just stayed in Akron for a couple nights.

**TPM:** So there might be a ceiling?

**Peggy:** That's my guess. I don't know if it's a hard cap or a curve or what, but after a certain amount, the system just stops caring. You could turn in a diamond-encrusted invoice and it would shrug.

**TPM:** Any idea where that "point" is?

**Peggy:** Gosh, not exactly. I want to say it's somewhere around... "corporate suspicious," if that makes sense? Like, if you're buying steak dinners three nights in a row, the system just puts up a wall. But it's not about line items—it's total value. I once submitted a stack of itemized stuff for a vendor summit—very reasonable, all compliant—and the reimbursement didn't budge past a certain point.

**TPM:** Interesting. What about small receipts? Low-dollar totals?

**Peggy:** Oh, those are tricky. I always warn folks: don't come back from a trip and just turn in a parking stub and a Snickers. The system really doesn't like that. You're better off claiming nothing.

**TPM:** So small totals are discouraged?

**Peggy:** I wouldn't say discouraged exactly… but they're definitely not rewarded. One time, Kyle from procurement turned in like $8.50 in receipts after driving up to HQ for a one-day workshop. He said he got reimbursed less than the gas cost. We had a good laugh, but I could see he wasn't joking.

**TPM:** Do you think the system penalized him?

**Peggy:** I think so. It's like it thought he was trying to "game" the system. Like—"That's not travel, Kyle. That's Tuesday."

**TPM:** That's helpful. Now, have you noticed anything about longer trips?

**Peggy:** Oh yes. There's something magical that happens at a certain trip length. We don't know what it is exactly, but Finance has a joke—"Stay just long enough to make it worth your while."

I remember I went to the regional HR summit in Charlotte years back—five nights, lots of walking, my plantar fasciitis was flaring—and the reimbursement was unexpectedly generous. More than I was expecting. Like, it felt like a reward for sticking it out the full week.

**TPM:** So there's a sort of sweet spot?

**Peggy:** Exactly. Not too short. Not too long. Like Myrtle Beach in May.

**TPM:** [laughs] That sounds oddly specific.

**Peggy:** It's the humidity, I swear. But back to the system—it seems to offer a little something extra around day five? Maybe day six? You hit a stretch where it just... pats you on the back with an extra line item.

**TPM:** Any sense of what happens if the trip goes longer than that?

**Peggy:** Oh, then you're on your own. [laughs] I mean, I did a ten-day training session in Denver once, and the reimbursement didn't really scale after a certain point. Felt like I was being punished for staying diligent.

But here's the weird part—it wasn't just about the length. It seemed to care about how much I was spending per day too. Like, if you're on a long trip and you're living it up every night, the system gets... judgmental.

**TPM:** How so?

**Peggy:** Well, on that Denver trip, I was staying at a nice hotel, eating well—probably averaging $180 a day in expenses. And I swear the reimbursement felt... stingy. Like it was saying, "Ten days AND you're spending like a tourist? Pick one."

But then I had a colleague do a similar-length trip to Phoenix, super frugal—maybe $60 a day—and she came out way better than expected.

**TPM:** So the system might look at daily spending rates?

**Peggy:** That's my theory. It's like it has opinions about your lifestyle choices. Spend too much per day on a long trip? Penalty box. Keep it modest on a short trip? Gold star.

**TPM:** Interesting—so a bump around a mid-length trip, but not linear beyond that.

**Peggy:** That's right. Short trips feel stingy. Medium trips feel nice. Long ones? The system thinks you're on sabbatical. Unless you're being really careful with your spending—then it might cut you some slack.

**TPM:** Does anyone track or model this internally?

**Peggy:** Oh we tried. Years ago, someone on the FP&A team built a dashboard called "REIMBURSE-O-METER." Very flashy. Lots of gradients. But it never matched the actual payouts. I think the logic was too chaotic—or too personal. Like it had opinions. The system, I mean.

**TPM:** You're saying the algorithm had vibes?

**Peggy:** Exactly. It's like it knew when you were being frugal and when you were trying to sneak in a seafood tower. Speaking of which—have you ever been to Captain George's in Myrtle? It's the buffet. I go every summer. Bring stretch pants.

**TPM:** I haven't—but I'll put it on the list. Any last thoughts on the system?

**Peggy:** Just this: no one really understands it, but we all live with it. Like an eccentric relative. You don't question it—you just plan around it.

If you're trying to replace it, my advice? Keep the quirks. People have grown oddly fond of them.

**TPM:** Peggy, this has been incredibly helpful—thank you so much.

**Peggy:** My pleasure! And hey, if you ever need a spreadsheet audited from a beach chair, you know where to find me.

## Tom from HR

**Role:** Senior Benefits Compliance Partner  
**Date:** April 3, 2025  
**Duration:** 44 minutes

**TPM:** Tom, thanks for joining today.

**Tom:** Oh, sure, no problem. Always happy to help, especially when it's not another session about PTO accrual recalibration. [laughs]

**TPM:** That sounds intense.

**Tom:** You don't even know. It's like watching paint dry, but the paint is covered in legal disclosures. Honestly, I'm glad for the break. This reimbursement stuff is quirky, but at least it has personality.

**TPM:** [laughs] I've heard that a lot. Before we start—how's your week been?

**Tom:** Good, good! Busy. We had a litter born Monday night—six miniature schnauzers, four silver, two pepper-salt. It was a whole thing. I had to sleep in the mudroom. I keep telling myself I'll stop breeding after this batch, but then another round of puppies shows up and—well, here we are.

**TPM:** Wow. I didn't know you bred schnauzers.

**Tom:** Oh, it's my thing. Been doing it since '09. Started as a hobby, now I'm a "recognized multi-ribbon kennel" or whatever the Midwest club calls it. You should see the Christmas card photos—full tuxedos.

**TPM:** That's amazing. Let's pivot into the reimbursement system—what's your experience been with it?

**Tom:** Oh boy. The old beast. We use it in HR mostly for candidate travel and relocation stipends. Every time we onboard a VP-level hire, we submit receipts and pray the number makes sense.

**TPM:** Have you noticed any patterns with long trips?

**Tom:** Yes! Funny you mention that. We had an exec relocation case last year—from Seattle to Chicago. The move took like nine days start to finish. Temporary housing, ground travel, a couple hotel nights while their furniture was in transit. We filed the whole thing and—get this—the reimbursement came back lower than a five-day trip we did for a director flying in from Tampa.

**TPM:** That's odd.

**Tom:** Right? It's almost like the system didn't like the trip being that long. As if after a certain point, it goes "Hmm… no thanks."

**TPM:** Do you think that's intentional?

**Tom:** Hard to say. Could be legacy logic. Could be some weird cap on "extended travel." We've speculated internally that it does a little bonus if the trip hits a sweet spot, but punishes anything longer. Like it's trying to say, "Don't overstay your welcome."

**TPM:** So trips over a week seem to yield less than expected?

**Tom:** That's been our experience, yes. Even when receipts are high. Which is a whole other thing…

**TPM:** We'll get there. How about travel distance? Does the number of miles seem to influence the result?

**Tom:** Mmm. That one's murky. But here's an example: We had a new hire come in from Little Rock—drove in, actually. 600-something miles. That person got a surprisingly consistent payout—plus a little extra, even though the receipt total wasn't very high.

**TPM:** Interesting.

**Tom:** Contrast that with another hire from St. Louis, about 250 miles away. No bonus. Same travel length. Nearly identical expenses. But the person from further away walked out a little ahead.

**TPM:** Do you think there's a distance bonus?

**Tom:** I think it kicks in around what I'd call "logistically annoying" distances. Like, once it's far enough that it probably required a flight, rental car, or serious planning, the system throws in a little extra. My gut says it's a flat amount. Like a "you put in the effort" token.

**TPM:** Any chance it's tied to departments?

**Tom:** Possibly? Though we've seen it in both HR and Operations. I don't think it's department-specific. More like—it notices the shape of the trip. It's very "vibe-aware," this system. [laughs]

But here's something weird I noticed recently. We had two candidates with very similar profiles—both drove about 700 miles, both stayed three days. But one was doing a whirlwind tour, hitting multiple offices, really covering ground. The other was more... leisurely. Hotel, conference center, hotel.

**TPM:** And the reimbursements were different?

**Tom:** The road warrior came out way ahead. Like, noticeably better. It's almost like the system could tell who was actually working hard and who was just... present.

**TPM:** That's fascinating.

**Tom:** Right? It's like breeding schnauzers—you can follow the book, but sometimes a puppy just has a little extra sparkle, you know? The system seems to have similar instincts about travel patterns.

**TPM:** I'll take your word for it.

**TPM:** What about strange rounding issues?

**Tom:** Oh, yes. We had a candidate dinner receipt that came in at... I want to say something like $199.99. And the reimbursement came out weirdly specific. Like $1.02 more than expected. I ran it through our estimation sheet twice.

**TPM:** Hmm.

**Tom:** And I know what you're thinking: maybe tax, maybe tipping logic—but no. It wasn't a percent-based adjustment. It felt like… some kind of rounding rule gone wrong. Like maybe the system tries to round twice and ends up adding instead of flattening.

**TPM:** That sounds like a bug.

**Tom:** Could be. Could also be intentional. You never know with legacy code. Sometimes the bug becomes the feature. I've worked with enough retired devs to know—if you can't explain it, ship it.

But here's another weird thing—we started noticing that the reimbursement amounts seemed to vary based on... timing? Like, the same exact trip submitted in different quarters would come back with slightly different numbers.

**TPM:** Different how?

**Tom:** Small differences, but consistent. Like the system was in different "moods" depending on when you submitted. We started joking that it had seasonal affective disorder. End of quarter? More generous. Middle of the fiscal year? Tighter with the purse strings.

**TPM:** That's... oddly human.

**Tom:** Right? It's like the system absorbed the company culture. Budget constraints, approval fatigue, end-of-year spending pushes—all baked into the algorithm somehow.

**TPM:** So to summarize: long trips might get penalized, far distances might trigger a flat bonus, receipts with funny decimals might cause rounding surprises, and there might be some kind of seasonal variation?

**Tom:** That's a nice way of putting it. I just tell my team: "Keep it medium and keep it clean." Don't get fancy. Don't get greedy. And round up. Oh, and submit at the right time of year if you can help it.

**TPM:** Wise words.

**Tom:** You should see my schnauzer reimbursement form. Perfectly filled out. Clean margins. She's a professional.

**TPM:** [laughs] I'll bet. Well, Tom, this has been fantastic. Genuinely helpful.

**Tom:** Glad to help. And hey—if you ever want a puppy, just say the word. I have a black-and-silver female with show potential and excellent temperament. House-trained on a spreadsheet.

## Sarah from Operations

**Role:** Regional Logistics Coordinator  
**Date:** April 5, 2025  
**Duration:** 38 minutes

**TPM:** Sarah, thanks for making time today.

**Sarah:** Of course! Always happy to help, especially when it involves complaining about the old expense system. [laughs] It's like therapy.

**TPM:** [laughs] I'm getting that sense. How's your day going?

**Sarah:** Oh, you know, the usual chaos. I've got three site visits to coordinate next week, and I'm trying to figure out which combination of flights, hotels, and rental cars will make the expense system least angry with me.

**TPM:** That's actually perfect—you probably see more travel patterns than most people.

**Sarah:** Oh, absolutely. I coordinate travel for about 40 people across five states. I've seen every possible way the system can surprise you. And trust me, it's creative.

**TPM:** What's the weirdest pattern you've noticed?

**Sarah:** Okay, so this is going to sound crazy, but I swear the system has favorite types of trips. Like, it has preferences.

**TPM:** Go on.

**Sarah:** So we have these "sprint" trips—you know, fly in, hit three locations in two days, fly out. High mileage, short duration, usually pretty expensive because you're moving fast. The system loves these. I mean, loves them. People come back with reimbursements that are like 20% higher than you'd expect.

**TPM:** Interesting.

**Sarah:** But then we have the opposite—what I call "camping trips." Someone goes to our Phoenix office for a week-long training, barely leaves the building, maybe drives to dinner a few times. Low mileage, long duration, modest expenses. The system... does not approve. It's like it's saying, "You're not really traveling, you're just sleeping somewhere else."

**TPM:** So it rewards intensity?

**Sarah:** That's exactly it! It's like it can calculate effort per day or something. High miles per day? Gold star. Low miles per day? Penalty box.

But here's where it gets really weird—it also seems to care about the spending pattern. If you're on one of those intense trips and you're spending like crazy every day, it starts to get... judgmental.

**TPM:** How so?

**Sarah:** We had a sales director do a four-city tour last month. Really hustling—800 miles in three days. But he was staying at nice hotels, expensive dinners, the works. Probably $250 a day in expenses. His reimbursement was way lower than expected.

Compare that to another guy who did a similar trip but kept it modest—maybe $80 a day. He came out way ahead.

**TPM:** So the system looks at daily spending rates?

**Sarah:** I think so. It's like it has this internal sense of what's "reasonable" for different types of trips. Spend too much per day on a long trip? Penalty. Keep it modest on a short trip? Bonus.

**TPM:** Have you noticed anything about specific combinations of factors?

**Sarah:** Oh, absolutely. There are these sweet spots that everyone in Ops knows about. Like, if you can hit the magic combination—medium length trip, decent mileage, reasonable expenses—the system practically throws money at you.

But if you hit the wrong combination... [laughs] We had someone do a two-day trip to Cleveland, barely drove anywhere, turned in like $150 in receipts. The reimbursement was almost insulting.

**TPM:** What about really big trips?

**Sarah:** Those are interesting. If you can hit all the right notes—long trip, high mileage, high expenses—the system gives you this massive bonus. Like it's saying, "Okay, you're clearly doing something important."

But you have to hit all three. Miss one, and it's just a regular reimbursement.

**TPM:** That sounds very specific.

**Sarah:** It is! We actually have an informal betting pool about which trips will trigger the "jackpot." Last month, Janet from compliance hit it perfectly—eight-day trip, 900 miles, $1,200 in expenses. Came back with a reimbursement that was like 25% higher than anyone expected.

**TPM:** Do you think there are other hidden factors?

**Sarah:** Oh, definitely. I've started tracking submission timing, and there are definitely patterns. End of quarter? More generous. Middle of the fiscal year? Tighter. It's like the system has moods.

**TPM:** That's fascinating.

**Sarah:** Right? It's like it absorbed the company's budget cycle somehow. We joke that it has seasonal affective disorder.

**TPM:** Any advice for people trying to understand the system?

**Sarah:** [laughs] Don't try to understand it—just learn to work with it. Keep your trips "medium" when possible, don't be too greedy with expenses, and submit at the right time of year.

Oh, and if you're going to do a big trip, go all out. The system respects commitment.

**TPM:** Sarah, this has been incredibly helpful. Thank you.

**Sarah:** Anytime! And hey, if you need someone to test the new system with some real-world travel scenarios, I'm your person. I've got trips planned through the end of the year.
