Based on the design plan analysis, this document outlines the high-level tasks and detailed sub-tasks required to implement the integrated deterministic-stochastic approach for the legacy reimbursement system reverse engineering.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Build Deterministic Foundation Engine (BUSINESS LOGIC PRIORITY)
  - [x] 1.1 Implement data pattern discovery to identify mathematical relationships between inputs and outputs
  - [x] 1.2 Create linear coefficient discovery system to test formulas like `base + rate_per_day * days + rate_per_mile * miles + receipt_rate * receipts`
  - [x] 1.3 Extract and implement specific business rules from employee interviews (per diem logic, receipt ceilings, sweet spots, jackpots) - MOST EFFECTIVE (+0.83% R²)
  - [x] 1.4 Mine additional business logic from interview edge cases and exceptions (rounding rules, seasonal variations, efficiency bonuses, spending interactions) - VERY EFFECTIVE (+1.33% R²)

- [x] 2.0 HIGH-PRECISION ACCURACY ENHANCEMENT (REVISED TARGET: 90%+ R² with business logic)
  - [x] 2.1 Deep residual analysis to identify missing business logic patterns (systematic errors indicate undiscovered rules) - CRITICAL PATTERNS FOUND (69.8% variance reduction needed)
  - [x] 2.2 Advanced interview mining - extract every quantitative detail, threshold, percentage, condition mentioned but not yet implemented - PRECISION RULES DISCOVERED (42 new rules)

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Constraints
- **Cannot modify `run.sh`** - must work within existing script structure
- **Overfitting Prevention**: Maximum 5 features in any model, mandatory cross-validation for all approaches
- **Success Criteria**: Cross-validation accuracy >85%, test accuracy within 10% of CV accuracy

### Integration Philosophy
- **Deterministic foundation + stochastic enhancement**, not competition between approaches
- Each approach must inform and validate the other
- Focus on `final = deterministic_baseline + stochastic_residual_correction`

### Validation Requirements
- Both approaches must achieve independent validation before integration
- 10-fold cross-validation mandatory for all components
- Holdout test set (20%) never touched until final validation
- Monitor for >5% train/validation accuracy gaps (overfitting flag)

### Complexity Limits (UPDATED based on Task 2.5 failure)
- No neural networks or complex ensemble methods
- No variable coefficients or context-dependent models (causes overfitting)
- Maximum 5 parameters in any ML component (learned from Task 2.5 catastrophic failure)
- Strong simplicity bias: always prefer interpretable rules over complex models
- Heavy regularization if any ML is used

### Key Success Metrics (REVISED based on progress)
1. **✓ ACHIEVED**: Deterministic alone achieves 86.78% accuracy with high interpretability
2. **REVISED**: Pure business logic reaches 90%+ accuracy (realistic vs original 95% target)
3. **CONDITIONAL**: If pure rules fail, minimal hybrid approach improves deterministic by >3% absolute accuracy  
4. **CRITICAL**: Final system maintains interpretability and avoids overfitting (lesson from Task 2.5)

## CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY (as of Task 2.6 completion)

**Current Best Performance**: 86.78% R² (missing business logic discovery)
**Target**: 90%+ R² with pure business rules (revised from unrealistic 95% target)
**Gap Remaining**: 3.22% to reach 90% target
**Next Steps**: Task 2.7 (exhaustive error analysis) for final push to 90%+

**Key Learnings**:
- ✓ Interpretable business rules work well (80.19% → 86.78% R²)
- ✗ Complex approaches cause catastrophic overfitting (Task 2.5: 86.78% → 54.41%)
- ✓ Incremental rule discovery provides steady improvements
- ⚠️ Diminishing returns suggest 90% may be limit for pure business logic

**Files Created**:
- `pattern_discovery.py` (80.19% R²)
- `calibrated_business_rules.py` (81.01% R²) 
- `complex_business_rule_discovery.py` (87.47% projected)
- `precision_parameter_tuning.py` (85.72% R²)
- `variable_coefficient_system.py` (FAILED - 54.41% R²)
- `missing_business_logic_discovery.py` (86.78% R²)

## Background Context

This task list addresses the catastrophic failure of the original ML approach that achieved 100% training accuracy but only 0.1% test accuracy (4/5000 exact matches). The root causes were:

1. **Severe Overfitting**: Decision tree memorized training examples instead of learning business rules
2. **No Cross-Validation**: Failed to validate generalization during development
3. **Complexity Over Simplicity**: Chose complex ML over simple business logic
4. **Feature Engineering Overkill**: Created 27 features that enabled memorization

The new integrated approach combines interpretable deterministic rules with constrained stochastic methods, where each approach informs and validates the other to prevent overfitting while maximizing generalization.
