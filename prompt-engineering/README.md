# Prompt Engineering Framework for Black Box Challenges

This directory contains a comprehensive prompt engineering approach that achieved 100% accuracy on a legacy travel reimbursement system reverse-engineering challenge.

## Overview

The framework follows the proven **EPIC methodology** (Explore, Plan, Implement, Commit) and provides both strategic high-level prompts and detailed implementation code for systematic black box problem solving.

## Directory Structure

### `/parent-prompt/`
- **ParentPrompt.md** - Original challenge specification and requirements

### `/claude-code-tutorials/`  
- **claude_code_prompts.md** - 8 strategic prompts for different phases of black box reverse engineering:
  1. Initial Setup and Strategic Planning
  2. Document Analysis and Business Rule Extraction  
  3. Systematic Rule-Based Discovery Engine
  4. Advanced Machine Learning Pipeline
  5. Intelligent Error Analysis and Model Fusion
  6. Production Implementation and Validation
  7. Complete Autonomous Implementation
  8. Alternative Streamlined Approach

### `/design-documents/`
- **blackbox-design-plan.md** - Comprehensive technical architecture and implementation plan

### `/implementation-framework/`
- **blackbox-implementation-code.py** - Master implementation following EPIC methodology with modular classes
- **document-analyzer.py** - Specialized module for extracting business rules from documentation

## Key Success Patterns

✅ **Hybrid Approach**: Combine rule-based discovery with machine learning  
✅ **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple strategies simultaneously  
✅ **Systematic Error Analysis**: Understand and fix every prediction failure  
✅ **Document Integration**: Extract maximum value from available hints  
✅ **100% Accuracy Focus**: Don't settle for "close enough"

## Usage

1. **Start with Strategic Planning** using Prompt 1 from claude_code_prompts.md
2. **Reference the Design Plan** for technical architecture decisions
3. **Use Implementation Framework** as starting point for coding
4. **Apply Specialized Prompts** (2-6) for specific challenges
5. **Execute Complete Pipeline** with Prompt 7 for full automation

This framework is designed to be reusable across different types of black box reverse engineering challenges while maintaining the systematic approach that delivers optimal results.
